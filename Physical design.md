# Floorplanning

- This stage involves defining the physical structure of the synthesized hierarchical ALU by allocating space, creating rows, and placing macros using Synopsys IC Compiler II (ICC2)
- The floorplan was created after synthesis and netlist import.

- Each ALU sub-module (add, subtract, increment, decrement) is built using the full_adder macro.

 Floorplan view of the hierarchical ALU design with 4 sub-modules (FA_add, FA_sub, FA_inc, FA_dec) using full_adder macros.





# Macro Placement

- The ALU design consists of four macro blocks:
   - FA_inc, FA_dec, FA_sub, and FA_add

- Each macro is an instance of the reusable block full_adder synthesized into fulladder.db.

- The macros were placed manually for better spatial organization and easier routing.

- Manual placement ensures:

   - Predictable routing paths

   - Improved control over congestion

   - Better utilization of core area

# Keepout Margins
- A keepout margin was applied around each macro using ICC2â€™s GUI features.

- Purpose of keepout margins:

   -Prevents standard cell placement too close to the macros

   - Avoids routing congestion near macro edges

   - Ensures clean spacing for power/ground rails and signal routes
